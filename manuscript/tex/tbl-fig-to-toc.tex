% Ew this is gross but it works! This adds all the figure and table captions to 
% the table of contents automatically so that there's no need for separate 
% \listoffigures or \listoftables sections. 
%
% At first I tried modifying the \caption command to inject 
% \addcontentsline{}{}{} in it (both with \patchcmd{\@caption}{blah} and with 
% etoolbox), but that apparently doesn't work because of LaTeX's two-pass system 
% for numbering, or something. Either the captions wouldn't appear in the TOC, 
% or they'd appear misnumbered---the first table would appear as Table 0 in the 
% TOC, but be Table 1 in the document
%
% So this uses some conditional flags to help LaTeX recognize when it's in a 
% table or figure, and then adds TOC entries accordingly.
