### OSF question

Please list each research question included in this study.
:::

We use a conjoint survey experiment to examine the impact of organizational features of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the structural factors in target countries in which they operate on donors’ decisions to engage in philanthropy. We explore three research questions in this study:

1. **Do donors rely on structural characteristics of NGOs as heuristics when deciding to donate? How do structural heuristics compare to organizational heuristics?**

    Donors rely on shortcuts, signals, and heuristics to determine the trustworthiness of NGOs, since seeking out complete information about an organization's deservingness and efficiency is costly and time-consuming. Previous research has found that an NGO's organizational characteristics commonly serve as heuristics for donors. Donors use an organization's overhead costs, the issues it works on, its transparency and accountability practices, and a host of other organizational practices as signals of an organization's efficiency and deservingness, which then influences their decision to make a donation. These kinds of heuristics are attributes that organizations can typically control—NGOs can publish annual reports, restructure their management, and engage in other strategies to appear more worthy of donation.

    Structural characteristics, such as the political and legal environment an NGO faces in its host country, may also serve as signals to donors of NGO deservingness. We are interested in whether the contentiousness of an NGO’s relationship with its host government influences donor decision making. Do donors care if nonprofits they care about are criticized by, persecuted by, or expelled from the countries they work in?

    We are also interested in the effect of organizational characteristics on donor decision making. How do managerial practices (financial transparency and accountability systems), funding sources (private donations and government grants), and issue areas (emergency response, environmental issues, human rights, and refugee relief) compare to structural characteristics when deciding to donate? Which heuristics are more influential?
	
2. **How do individual-level donor characteristics interact with structural and organizational heuristics? Which kinds of people are more or less likely to consider an NGO's host country political environment, managerial practices, funding sources, or issue area?**  

    The decision to donate to an NGO is not determined solely by an organization's characteristics. Donors themselves have personality traits, preferences, and experiences that make them more or less likely to engage in philanthropy. We are interested in how individual donor characteristics, such as political ideology, political knowledge, religious attendance, involvement in charitable activities, involvement in activism, and demographic attributes interact with organizational- and structural-level factors. 

3. **What is the optimal mix of attribute levels for NGOs interested in maximizing donations?**

    Finally, given individual donor characteristics and preferences, we are interested in finding the optimal mix of organizational and structural attributes. What might an NGO try to emphasize in its marketing campaigns? Should it highlight its funding sources, managerial practices, issue area, or relationship with its host governments (even if that relationship is negative)?


#### Hypotheses

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

For each of the research questions listed in the previous section, provide one or multiple specific and testable hypotheses. Please state if the hypotheses are directional or non-directional. If directional, state the direction. A predicted effect is also appropriate here.
:::

For our first set of questions, we predict that: 

1. **Branding**

    - Donors will be more likely to donate to Oxfam and Red Cross compared to Amnesty International and Greenpeace [Mechanism: awareness of need and contentiousness of issue area]

2. **Government crackdown**

    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are facing government crackdown or criticism [Mechanism: Governments wouldn't be cracking down on them if they didn't perceive a threat from them which means organizations implementing their missions effectively. This perception of efficacy leads to increased donations.]
    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to Oxfam and Red Cross when they are facing government crackdown or criticism compared to when Amnesty or Greenpeace is facing crackdown.

3. **Issue area**

    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs working in less contentious issue areas (emergency response and refugee relief) over more contentious issue areas (environment and human rights) 
    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs facing government crackdown/criticism working in less contentious issue areas (emergency response and refugee relief) over more contentious issue areas (environment and human rights) [Mechanisms: Perceptions of deservingness of NGOs dealing with emergency response and refugee relief. Donors are also more likely to donate to programs that are compatible with government preferences and have easily measurable outputs, which environment and human rights programs often lack. NGOs working on more contentious issue areas may be expelled or shut down, which would be a waste of donor resources, make it less likely that they donate to these groups.]

4. **Funding sources**

    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are funded primarily by numerous small private donors compared to NGOs that are funded by a handful of wealhty private donors and government grants [Mechanism: Perception of efficacy - your contribution matters as a small donor. Government funding may also imply lack of independence of government which can reduce the efficiency of an organization.]
    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are facing government crackdown and are funded primarily by numerous small private donors
    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are facing government crackdown and are funded primarily by numerous small private donors and work in less contentious areas (emergency response and refugee relief) 

5. **Organizational practices**

    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are financially transparent [Mechanism: Perception of efficacy]
    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are criticized by the government/under government crackdown when they are also financially transparent
    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are criticized by the government/under government crackdown when they are also financially transparent and are funded primarily by numerous small private donors
    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are criticized by the government/under government crackdown when they are also financially transparent and work in less contentious areas (emergency response and refugee relief) 
    - Donors will show increased willingness to donate to NGOs that are criticized by the government/under government crackdown when they are also financially transparent and work in less contentious areas (emergency response and refugee relief) and are funded by numerous small donors
    - Donors should be no more or less likely to donate to NGOs that are accountable and hold regular third party audits [Mechanism: Donors don't necessarily seek assurance through third-party programs/audits and charity watchdogs, but rather through word of mouth, personal scrutiny and local networks]

Because of the nature of our statistical methods, we do not have exact hypotheses for the second and third set of questions. We describe how we answer these questions in the "Follow-up analyses" and "Exploratory analysis" sections below.


### Sampling Plan

#### Existing data

Registration prior to creation of data

#### Explanation of existing data

We will not use any existing data.

#### Data collection procedures

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

Please describe the process by which you will collect your data. If you are using human subjects, this should include the population from which you obtain subjects, recruitment efforts, payment for participation, how subjects will be selected for eligibility from the initial pool (e.g. inclusion and exclusion rules), and your study timeline. For studies that don’t include human subjects, include information about how you will collect samples, duration of data gathering efforts, source or location of samples, or batch numbers you will use.
:::

Participants will complete a 10-minute survey on Qualtrics. A static version of the survey is accessible at `REDACTED`.

Participants of the survey experiment will be recruited through Centiment, a commercial online provider of high quality nonprobability opt-in survey panels. Centiment ensures panel quality by actively recruiting representative samples of the US population and provides monetary incentives and rewards to participants.

To see how varying NGO characteristics influence the decision to donate, our sample will be representative of a population of people who are likely to donate to charity. We ask potential participants a screening question early in the survey (“Q2.5: How often do you donate to charity”). If a participant responds that they give to once every few years or never, they will be disqualified from the study and the survey will end early.

We will provide Centiment with a link to the survey, which is hosted by Qualtrics. Centiment will then distribute the link to their panel. Participants are compensated through Centiment’s internal reward system through cash, points, and other incentives. Centiment does not provide precise details of participant compensation. Centiment states that their compensation is “fair,” and the company’s business model encourages the company to find and maintain high quality panelists. We thus infer that the amount provided is fair and justified. Centiment users receive compensation from the company following the completion of the survey.


#### Sample size

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed in the study? This could be the number of people, birds, classrooms, plots, interactions, or countries included. If the units are not individuals, then describe the size requirements for each unit. If you are using a clustered or multilevel design, how many units are you collecting at each level of the analysis?
:::

Our target sample size is 1,000 participants.


#### Sample size rationale

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

This could include a power analysis or an arbitrary constraint such as time, money, or personnel.
:::

A sample size of at least 500 respondents is typical for estimating a hierarchical Bayesian model based on conjoint data. We double this amount because we are interested in analyzing subpopulations of respondents, which requires a larger sample, and we had sufficient budget to acquire up to 1,000 respondents.


#### Stopping rule

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
###  OSF question

If your data collection procedures do not give you full control over your exact sample size, specify how you will decide when to terminate your data collection. 
:::

Centiment will monitor how many surveys are successfully completed and will solicit responses until our 1,000 target is met.


### Design plan

#### Study type

Experiment: A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.

#### Blinding

For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.

#### Study design

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

Describe your study design. Examples include two-group, factorial, randomized block, and repeated measures. Is it a between (unpaired), within-subject (paired), or mixed design? Describe any counterbalancing required. Typical study designs for observation studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies. 
:::

We use a fractional factorial design. Since no single respondent can possibly see all possible combinations of the attribute levels, we create a number of different versions of the experimental design. We utilize a hierarchical Bayesian model in part to allow for information sharing across like respondents when estimating individual-level preferences for the attribute levels.


#### Randomization

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

If you are doing a randomized study, how will you randomize, and at what level? 
:::

Every respondent will be randomly assigned a version of the fractional factorial experimental design.


### Analysis Plan

#### Statistical models

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis? Please include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or covariates). Please specify any interactions that will be tested and remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article.
:::

We will use a hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logit model with conjugate or otherwise typical priors. The individual-level model is the multinomial logit and the upper-level model of heterogeneity is multivariate normal,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\beta &\sim \operatorname{Multivariate} \mathcal{N}(Z \Gamma, \xi) \\
y &\sim \operatorname{Multinomial logit}(X \beta, \varepsilon)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $y$ = which alternative the respondent chooses to donate, $X$ = design matrix of attribute levels, $\beta$ = latent individual preferences for the attribute levels, $Z$ = matrix of individual-level covariates, $\Gamma$ = matrix of coefficients mapping individual-level covariates onto the latent individual-level preferences, and $\varepsilon$ and $\xi$ = errors.

#### Inference criteria

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information you’ll use (e.g. specify the p-values, Bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this? 
:::

We will examine the aggregate marginal posterior distributions of the attribute levels and use 95% credible intervals to establish "significance." Effects are "significant" if the 95% credible intervals don't include 0. Similarly, marginal posterior distributions are "significantly" different if the 95% credible intervals don't overlap.

We will examine the marginal posterior distributions of the following models:

- Organizational and structural attribute levels with an intercept-only distribution of heterogeneity
- Organizational and structural attribute levels with competing sets of covariates in the distribution of heterogeneity

Finally, we will employ the posterior distribution of model parameters to conduct counterfactual analyses via a market simulator to determine optimal policies.

#### Data exclusion

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

How will you determine which data points or samples (if any) to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled?
:::

We ask potential participants a screening question early in the survey ("Q2.5: How often do you donate to charity"). If a participant responds that they give to once every few years or never, they will be disqualified from the study and the survey will end early.

We include one question ("*Q2.11*: Please select blue from the following list:") to monitor respondent attention. In our analysis we will exclude respondents who fail this question.

#### Missing data

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### OSF question

How will you deal with incomplete or missing data?
:::

Because all survey questions are required, we do not anticipate issues with incomplete or missing data.
