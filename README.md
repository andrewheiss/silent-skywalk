## Abstract

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are a core component of global
governance. Over the last two decades, however, many host governments
have cracked down on NGOs using a series of laws that adversely affect
the availability and use of traditional NGO funding. In response to this
dramatic shift in the funding landscape, international NGOs have
increasingly turned to individual donors to offset the loss funding.
Prior research on NGO fundraising has examined how financial
transparency and organizational accountability influence individual
donor behavior. How do these elements of private donor decision-making
interact with structural-level factors such as worsening host country
civic environments when deciding to donate? Using a conjoint experiment
with likely donors in the US, we find that transparency and
accountability can protect against the dampening effect of host
government crackdown and criticism of NGOs. Our results have important
implications for how NGOs can adapt to worsening civic environments.

### 🤐🌥️🚶: Note on “silent skywalk” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to
generate a
[NICKA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._Department_of_Defense_and_partner_code_names)-style
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21).

codename(type = "nicka", seed = "why donors donate")
#> [1] "silent skywalk"
```
