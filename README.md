## Abstract

As space for civil society has closed around the world, transnational
NGOs have faced a crisis of funding. We explore how NGOs have shifted
from traditionally Northern funding sources toward grassroots private
philanthropic money. How do individual donors in the US feel about
donating to legally besieged NGOs abroad? Do legal restrictions on NGOs
influence donors’ decision to donate? We use a conjoint survey
experiment to argue that domestic political environments of NGO host
countries influence preferences of private donors and that legal
crackdowns on NGOs serve as a heuristic of organizational deservingness.

### 🤐🌥️🚶: Note on “silent skywalk” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to
generate a
[NICKA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._Department_of_Defense_and_partner_code_names)-style
internal-to-us project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21).

codename(type = "nicka", seed = "why donors donate") |> 
#> [1] "silent skywalk"
